  ## Goals

  Become proficient with working on a server and connecting a site via backend coding. I also, wanted to learn to deploy a page to Heroku since this was my first attempt to load a application to Heroku. The application accomplished the goals of using the GET, POST and DELETE methods I had planned when coding for this assignment. The application also takes advantage of fs, express, and path.

  ## Usage

  Save and delete Notes via express and JSON.

  ## Installation
  
  No Installation is needed for this project visit the deployed page to run the Note Taker Application.  

  ## Test

  visit the site and save and delete notes.

  ## Problems

  The most difficult part of designing the back end interface was getting the notes to delete and add correctly to JSON. The helper util folder made it easier to connect those pieces.

  ## Visualization

  placeholder to add images or other media
